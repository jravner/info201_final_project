_What is the dataset you'll be working with?_
  -Quandel API for stock data.

_Please include background on who collected the data, where you accessed it, and any additional information we should know about how this data came to be._
  -Quandel collected the data, and we accessed it from:
https://blog.quandl.com/api-for-stock-data?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=&utm_content=api-for-stock-data


_Who is your target audience? Depending on the domain of your data, there may be a variety of audiences interested in using the dataset.  You should hone in on one of these audiences._
  -People who are new investors or unfamiliar with general market trends looking to learn more about finance.

_What does your audience want to learn from your data?  Please list out at least 3 specific questions that your project will answer for your audience._
    -How can I make better investments?
    What are  some of the different industry trends?
    How do stock prices generally trend over time?


_How will you be reading in your data (i.e., are you using an API, or is it a static .csv/.json file)?_
  -We will be reading in csv file obtained from Quandel's stock API.

_What types of data-wrangling (reshaping, reformatting, etc.) will you need to do to your data?_
  -We will need to turn the csv file into a data frame, then create a table.

_What (major/new) libraries will be using in this project (no need to list common libraries that are used in many projects such as dplyr)_
  -No new major libraries.

_What major challenges do you anticipate?_
  -Filtering the data, and finding the right shiny app visualization for our data.

_Not required, but optional: what questions, if any, will you be answering with statistical analysis/machine learning?_
  -With statistical analysis, we could create a regression between different variables. We could also use common financial ratios and other metrics included with the API.
